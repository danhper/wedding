# Wedding app

Simple webapp to manage guests and invitations for my wedding with <a href="https://miyuki.ai">Ai</a>.
The website also implements a very simple Ethereum connect wallet wedding pot functionality, available to users with a wallet installed.

Live website with guest account at <https://perezmiyuki.wedding/?token=4uXQpoGPNUhRz1x0nK2U0A>

The guest management UI uses [administrate](https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate) and looks like this:
